## Executive Summary
This project implements an automated Detection Engineering capability using Anvilogic’s detection-as-code platform to expand detection coverage, standardize detection logic across telemetry sources, and establish a governed MITRE-aligned detection lifecycle. The effort also prepares a Snowflake integration and data tiering strategy to control storage costs and improve data quality for analytics.

## Background & Context
- Existing SOC struggles with detection coverage, noisy alerts, and inconsistent detection logic across SIEM and data lake platforms.
- Anvilogic offers detection-as-code, prebuilt detections and integrations that can standardize and accelerate detection deployment across environments.
- MITRE ATT&CK and D3FEND are authoritative frameworks for mapping adversary behaviors and defensive controls; aligning detection lifecycle to these frameworks improves coverage and governance.
- Snowflake is considered for future integration to centralize stored telemetry, enable analytics, and apply a data tiering strategy to optimize storage costs.

## Objectives (SMART where possible)
- Increase usable detection coverage by deploying and tuning Anvilogic prebuilt detections to cover 80% of high-priority ATT&CK techniques for the environment (measured by ATT&CK mapping inventory and detection deployment status).
- Reduce average false positive rate by 30% through automated tuning and agentic triage (measured by alert disposition rates in SOC triage dashboards).
- Unify telemetry ingestion from all critical sources (endpoint, identity, cloud, network, SIEM) into a consistent detection layer (measured by integration inventory and data source coverage >90% of required sources).
- Establish a governed detection lifecycle with versioned detection-as-code, peer review, and MITRE-aligned mapping (measured by process artifacts, policy, and % of detections with ATT&CK/D3FEND mappings).
- Prepare Snowflake integration plan and data tiering strategy that reduces projected storage cost growth by at least 25% versus un-tiered ingestion (measured by cost model and TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS projections).

## Scope
In-Scope:
- Deploy and tune Anvilogic prebuilt detections relevant to the environment.
- Integrate telemetry from identified sources (endpoint, identity, cloud, network, SIEM connectors) into the Anvilogic detection layer.
- Define detection lifecycle governance, including MITRE ATT&CK and D3FEND mapping standards, version control, and peer review process.
- Design Snowflake data tiering strategy and integration requirements (ingest, retention tiers, table types) — implementation may be planned for later phases.

Out-Of-Scope:
- Full replatforming of existing SIEM to Snowflake or other data platforms in Phase 1.
- Deep implementation of custom detection engineering beyond tuning and mapping of prebuilt detections (large custom detection projects to be scoped separately).
- Detailed implementation playbooks, code, or deployment scripts (this brief is high-level planning only).

## Key Stakeholders / Roles
- Project Sponsor: CISO (owner: CISO)
- Project Lead / Program Manager: SOC/Detection PM (owner: SOC PM)
- Detection Engineering Lead: Detection Engineering Manager (owner: Detection Eng)
- Platform/Cloud Architect: Cloud/Data Architect (owner: Cloud Arch)
- SIEM / Log Platform Owner (owner: SIEM Owner)
- Snowflake/Data Warehouse Owner (owner: Data Platform)
- SOC Operations Lead / Tier 1-3 Analysts (owner: SOC Ops)
- Compliance & Governance Lead (owner: Compliance)
- Vendor (Anvilogic) Technical Account Manager (owner: Anvilogic TAM)

## Success Criteria (metric + threshold + measurement approach)
- Detection Coverage: X% of prioritized ATT&CK techniques covered by deployed detections; Threshold: 80%; Measurement: ATT&CK mapping inventory exported from detection system.
- False Positive Reduction: Threshold: 30% reduction; Measurement: comparison of alert disposition (false positive rate) before vs after 90-day tuning window.
- Telemetry Coverage: Threshold: ≥90% of required telemetry sources integrated; Measurement: integration inventory and ingestion health metrics.
- Governance Adoption: Threshold: 100% of new/changed detections require versioned detection-as-code and peer review; Measurement: policy artifacts and version control logs.
- Snowflake Cost Optimization Preparedness: Threshold: Data tiering design and cost model documented with projected ≥25% storage cost reduction vs baseline; Measurement: Snowflake TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS-based projection and cost model.

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Assumption: Organization has available telemetry from endpoint, identity, cloud, and network sources or can enable them within project timelines.
- Assumption: Anvilogic access (trial or contract) and vendor support are available for integrations and onboarding.
- Constraint: Snowflake integration is planned but not executed in Phase 1 (design-only unless contractually agreed otherwise).
- Constraint: No major SIEM replatforming in-scope; Anvilogic will operate against existing platforms and data lakes where possible.
- Note: The user-stated figure of "~2000 out-of-the-box detections" is treated as UNVERIFIED in absence of corroborating vendor documentation for that exact count; Anvilogic public materials reference "thousands" of prebuilt detections (see Research Appendix).

- Risk: Telemetry gaps (missing sources or incomplete logs)
  - Likelihood: Medium
  - Impact: High (reduces detection effectiveness)
  - Mitigation: Early telemetry inventory, prioritized onboarding plan, fallbacks for proxy data; Owner: SIEM Owner / Cloud Arch

## Recommended Milestones & Quarterly Timeline (high-level)
- Q1 (Plan & PoC)
  - Telemetry inventory and priority use-case list (ATT&CK-mapped)
  - Procurement/contract with Anvilogic (PoC access)
  - PoC: deploy subset of prebuilt detections against representative telemetry; validate agentic tuning and triage
  - Snowflake readiness assessment and cost baseline
- Q2 (Scale Detections & Governance)
  - Deploy and tune prioritized detections across multiple telemetry sources
  - Establish detection lifecycle: version control, peer review, ATT&CK/D3FEND mapping standard
  - SOC process updates and analyst training
  - Data tiering design finalization for Snowflake
- Q3 (Integration & Optimization)

## High-level Resource Estimates (indicative)
- Core team: Project Lead (0.5 FTE), Detection Eng Lead (1 FTE), 2 Detection Engineers (2 FTE), Cloud/Data Architect (0.5 FTE), SOC Lead (0.5 FTE), Integration Engineer (1 FTE), Vendor TAM/Professional Services (as contracted).
- Additional: SOC analyst time for triage and tuning during PoC and rollout; possible third-party consultants for Snowflake designs.
- Note: These are high-level placeholders for planning; detailed estimates require scope confirmation.

## Required Integrations
- Anvilogic: detection-as-code platform (API/connectors, detection deployment, triage)
- Telemetry sources: Endpoint (EDR), Identity (IdP, IGA), Cloud (CloudTrail, Cloud logs), Network (firewall, proxy), Existing SIEM(s) (Splunk, Sentinel, etc.)
- Data platform: Snowflake (ingest pipelines, retention/tiering design) — design-first in early phases

## Governance & MITRE Alignment Approach (ATT&CK + D3FEND)
- Map each detection to ATT&CK tactic/technique and, where applicable, to D3FEND defensive techniques per the D3FEND crosswalk.
- Require metadata on each detection: ATT&CK mappings, data sources required, confidence level, owner, test cases, and tuning history.
- Establish peer review gate: code review for detection-as-code changes, mapping verification, and approval workflow enforced via version control.
- Track coverage heatmap: measure technique coverage by priority, identify gaps, and drive backlog for custom engineering.

## Data Tiering Strategy Overview for Snowflake Integration
- Use Snowflake table types to control CDP exposure: Temporary/Transient tables for high-churn or short-lived data; Permanent tables for low-churn, long-term facts.
- Monitor TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS to identify high Time Travel / Fail-safe consumption and adjust retention or table type.
- Apply tiering: hot (recent, frequently queried) in permanent tables with appropriate clustering/partitioning; warm (less frequent) in transient or compressed storage layers; cold (archive) moved to cheaper storage or external stages as appropriate.
- Plan ingestion patterns to purge staged files after load and avoid unnecessary time-travel overhead for high-churn telemetry.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Confirm project sponsorship and initial budget for PoC and vendor engagement.
2. Schedule kickoff to perform telemetry inventory and ATT&CK-prioritization workshop.
3. Engage Anvilogic TAM for PoC access and compatibility validation with key telemetry sources.
4. Prepare Snowflake cost baseline and table-level storage profiling to inform tiering decisions.
5. Produce a detailed Phase 1 plan (scope, timeline, success metrics, resourcing) for stakeholder approval.
