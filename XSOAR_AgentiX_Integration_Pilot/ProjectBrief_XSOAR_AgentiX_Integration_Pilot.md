## Scope Analysis
### Count & Classification Level:
- 1 - Feature
### Scale/Timebox
- Rule applied: Classify at the lowest SAFe level that fully captures the scope; use timebox heuristics where a Feature is deliverable by one ART within a single PI (≈8–12 weeks / up to 3 months).
- Rationale: The brief describes a single, integrated pilot to connect XSOAR and Agentic AI capabilities (secure connectors/APIs, AI-assisted playbook/script generation, and runtime orchestration) intended as an ART-deliverable capability within a single PI; it does not span multiple ARTs or quarters.
### Scoped Deliverable(s)
- Title: Agentic AI — XSOAR Integration Pilot
  - Summary: Deliver an integrated Agentic-AI to XSOAR pilot that implements secure connectors/APIs to Cortex XSOAR, an AI-assisted playbook/script generator that translates prompts into runnable playbooks or scripts, and runtime orchestration enabling agent-driven multi-step investigations executed within existing SOC workflows; expected outcomes include reduced manual playbook/script effort, measurable improvement in SOC response time and repeatability, and telemetry capture for evaluation.
