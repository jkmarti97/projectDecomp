## Original Request
Detection Engineering Automation
Automating Detection Engineering to Outpace Threats with Anvilogic

    Leverage Anvilogic's detection-as-code platform to hyperscal and streamline threat engineering detection.
    Core Objectives:
        Solve detection coverage issues with the ~2000 out-of-the-box detections provided by Anvilogic.
        Unify security telemetry across existing cyber tools.
        Establish a governed, MITRE-aligned (ATT&CK and D3FEND) detection lifecycle.
        Build foundation for future Snowflake intragration to optimize costs and data quality with a data tiering strategy.

## Executive Summary
Implement an automated detection engineering program using Anvilogic to increase detection coverage, unify telemetry across existing tooling, establish a governed MITRE-aligned detection lifecycle, and lay the groundwork for future Snowflake integration and data tiering to reduce costs and improve data quality.

## Background & Context
- The request aims to operationalize detection engineering using Anvilogic’s platform and detection content.
- Target outcomes include closing detection coverage gaps, standardizing detection lifecycle practices, and preparing for Snowflake-based analytics and storage.
- The user states an expectation of ~2000 out-of-the-box detections from Anvilogic (see Original Request).

## Objectives
- Increase measurable MITRE ATT&CK technique coverage to at least 75% (measurement: Anvilogic coverage scoring).
- Achieve unified ingestion and normalization for top telemetry sources (logs, endpoints, cloud) with 90% normalization rate (measurement: ingestion/parser reports).
- Implement a governed detection lifecycle (detect→test→deploy→monitor→retire) with versioning and auditability for 100% of new/modified detections (measurement: detection metadata and audit logs).
- Prepare Snowflake integration readiness (data tiering design and PoC data pipelines) to enable at least 30% storage cost reduction vs current hot-store usage (measurement: cost model comparison).

## Scope
In‑Scope
- Evaluate and onboard Anvilogic detection armory and detection lifecycle features.
- Map existing detections and telemetry to MITRE ATT&CK via Anvilogic tooling.
- Implement normalized telemetry ingestion for prioritized data sources and enable cross-platform detection translation (SPL/KQL/SQL) where feasible.
- Define governance, ownership, and versioning processes for detection-as-code artifacts.
- Design a Snowflake readiness plan and data tiering strategy (PoC scope only).

Out‑Of‑Scope
- Full Snowflake migration or broad data platform re-architecture (only PoC/design).
- Detailed implementation-level engineering, deployment pipelines, or code changes beyond detection definitions and lifecycle configuration.
- Writing production acceptance tests or creating runbooks for every detection.

## Key Stakeholders / Roles
- Project Sponsor: Security/CTO office (owner: executive sponsor)
- Detection Engineering Lead: owns detection content migration and MITRE mapping
- Security Engineering / Platform Owner: owns telemetry ingestion and normalization
- Data Architect (Snowflake readiness): owns PoC design and cost model
- SOC/Alerting Owner: owns detection tuning, alerting thresholds, and triage playbooks
- Compliance/Governance: owns policy alignment and audit requirements

## Success Criteria
- MITRE Technique Coverage: >=75% coverage measured by Anvilogic’s coverage score across prioritized telemetry (measurement: Anvilogic coverage report; owner: Detection Engineering Lead).
- Telemetry Normalization: >=90% normalization for prioritized sources (measurement: ingestion/parsing reports; owner: Security Engineering).
- Detection Lifecycle Governance: 100% of new/modified detections stored with versioning, metadata, and automated deployment pipelines managed in Anvilogic (measurement: detection metadata and audit logs; owner: Detection Engineering Lead).
- Snowflake Readiness: Data tiering PoC demonstrates >=30% reduction in projected storage/compute cost for cold-tier vs current hot-store usage (measurement: cost model comparison; owner: Data Architect).

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Assumes organization can provide access to telemetry sources and sample data feeds during onboarding.
- Assumes Anvilogic SaaS access and required connectors are available or can be provisioned.
- The exact count of out-of-the-box detections ("~2000") is not confirmed and is treated as UNVERIFIED in research.
- D3FEND mapping is not confirmed available in vendor documentation and is treated as UNVERIFIED.
- No production Snowflake migration is included; only design/PoC.
