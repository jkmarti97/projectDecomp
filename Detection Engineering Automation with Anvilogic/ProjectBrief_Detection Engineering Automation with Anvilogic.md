## Original Request
Detection Engineering Automation
Automating Detection Engineering to Outpace Threats with Anvilogic

    Leverage Anvilogic's detection-as-code platform to hyperscalal and streamline threat engineering detection.
    Core Objectives:
        Solve detection coverage issues with the ~2000 out-of-the-box detections provided by Anvilogic.
        Unify security telemetry across existing cyber tools.
        Establish a governed, MITRE-aligned (ATT&CK and D3FEND) detection lifecycle.
        Build foundation for future Snowflake integration to optimize costs and data quality with a data tiering strategy.

### Executive Summary
Implement an automated detection engineering program using Anvilogic to increase detection coverage, unify telemetry across existing tooling, establish a governed MITRE-aligned detection lifecycle, and lay the groundwork for future Snowflake integration and data tiering to reduce costs and improve data quality.

## Background & Context
- The request aims to operationalize detection engineering using Anvilogic’s platform and detection content.
- Target outcomes include closing detection coverage gaps, standardizing detection lifecycle practices, and preparing for Snowflake-based analytics and storage.
- The user states an expectation of ~2000 out-of-the-box detections from Anvilogic (see Original Request).

## Objectives
- Increase measurable MITRE ATT&CK technique coverage to at least 75% (measurement: Anvilogic coverage scoring).
- Achieve telemetry normalization >=90% for prioritized sources (measurement: ingestion/parser reports).
- Implement a governed detection lifecycle with versioning and auditability for 100% of new/modified detections (measurement: detection metadata and audit logs).
- Deliver Snowflake PoC designs and pipelines (PoC/design only) with projected >=30% hot-store cost reduction (measurement: PoC cost model).

[{"output":"## Scope Analysis\n### Count & Classification Level:\n- 1 — Epic\n### Scale/Timebox\n- Rule applied: Epic = 3–9 months, cross-team initiative requiring coordination across security, data/platform, and SOC; selected when work spans multiple stakeholder groups and is larger than a single ART/PI deliverable.\n- Applied estimate: 6–9 months.\n- Rationale: See Rationale section below.\n### Rationale\nThis is an enterprise, cross-cutting program that will touch detection engineering, telemetry ingestion and normalization, data platform (Snowflake PoC), governance, and SOC operations, requiring coordination across multiple teams and stakeholders; its scope and multi-disciplinary nature map to the Epic scale and multi-month timeframe.\n### Out-of-Scope\n- Full Snowflake migration or broad data platform re-architecture (PoC/design only for Snowflake).\n- Detailed CI/CD/deployment engineering or product-level code changes beyond detection definitions and lifecycle configuration.\n- Writing product acceptance tests or runbooks for every detection.\n### Scoped Deliverable(s)\n- Title: Enterprise Detection-as-Code Program with Anvilogic\n  - Summary: Implement an enterprise detection engineering program using Anvilogic to onboard the vendor detection armory and detection-as-code lifecycle, normalize prioritized telemetry sources, and establish governed detection lifecycles and ownership across teams. This Epic will encompass the following outcomes measured as: MITRE ATT&CK coverage >=75% (measured by Anvilogic coverage scoring), telemetry normalization >=90% for prioritized sources (measured via normalization metrics), and 100% versioning & auditability for new/modified detections (measured via detection metadata & audit logs), and delivery of Snowflake PoC designs and pipelines (PoC/design only) with a projected >=30% hot-store cost reduction (measured via PoC cost model). Constraints and assumptions: Snowflake work is PoC/design only (no full migration), detailed CI/CD and broad platform re-architecture are out of scope, the organization will provide telemetry access/sample feeds and Anvilogic SaaS/connectors, and vendor claims such as “~2000 out-of-the-box detections” and D3FEND mapping are UNVERIFIED and must be validated during onboarding; top risks include telemetry gaps, detection coverage shortfalls, and governance adoption—these will be addressed during discovery and prioritized mitigation planning.\n\nPlease review this scope brief and confirm approval or request any specific changes. Once you approve, I will append this scope brief to the project brief per the workflow."}]
