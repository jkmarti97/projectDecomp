### Original Request
Detection Engineering Automation
Automating Detection Engineering to Outpace Threats with Anvilogic

Leverage Anvilogic's detection-as-code platform to hyperscale and streamline threat engineering detection.
Core Objectives:
   Solve detection coverage issues with the ~2000 out-of-the-box detections provided by Anvilogic.
   Unify security telemetry across existing cyber tools.
   Establish a governed, MITRE-aligned (ATT&CK and D3FEND) detection lifecycle.
    Build foundation for future Snowflake integration to optimize costs and data quality with a data tiering strategy.

## Executive Summary
Implement an automated detection engineering program using Anvilogic to increase detection coverage, unify telemetry across existing tooling, establish a governed MITRE-aligned detection lifecycle, and lay the groundwork for future Snowflake integration to optimize costs and improve data quality.

## Background & Context
- The request aims to operationalize detection engineering using Anvilogic's platform and detection content to increase detection coverage, unify telemetry across existing tooling, establish a governed MITRE-aligned detection lifecycle, and lay the groundwork for Snowflake integration to optimize costs and data quality with a data tiering strategy.

## Scope Analysis
### Count & Classification Level:
- 1 — Portfolio Epic
### Scale/Timebox
- Rule applied: Portfolio Epic (>6 months, multiple ARTs or value streams, or significant cross-business investment)
- Rationale: The brief describes an organization-wide initiative to implement Detection-as-Code, telemetry ingestion and normalization, Snowflake integration, MITRE-mapped detection library, CI/CD pipelines, governance, and analytics that requires coordination across Security Engineering, Data Architecture, Platform/DevOps, Snowflake/POC owners, and product teams and is expected to span more than six months.
### Scoped Deliverable(s)
- Title: Organization-wide Detection-as-Code Platform (Anvilogic)
  - Summary: Deliver a cross-organization Detection-as-Code platform using Anvilogic to enable security teams to author, test, version, and deploy detection content at scale. Scope includes telemetry ingestion and normalization with Snowflake integration, a MITRE-mapped versioned detection library and repository, automated CI/CD for detection testing and multi-target deployment, governance/ownership/versioning processes, and product acceptance analytics (detection coverage, telemetry quality, and cost signals). Success will be measured by targets such as improving detection coverage (example target: +30% coverage), reducing false positives (example target: -25%), and shortening author-to-production time (example target: <2 weeks for vetted detections); the work will be piloted with one telemetry source and Snowflake as the initial execution/analytics target (pilot 3–6 months) and is anticipated to be delivered across multiple increments over ~9–18 months, to be decomposed into Features/Epics for execution.
