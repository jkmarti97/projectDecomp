## Executive Summary:
Leverage Anvilogic's detection-as-code platform to accelerate detection engineering, improve detection coverage using vendor-provided prebuilt detections mapped to MITRE ATT&CK (vendor language: "thousands / 1000s of detections"), unify telemetry across endpoint/identity/cloud/SIEM sources, and establish a governed MITRE ATT&CK-aligned detection lifecycle. Snowflake integration and full data-lake migration are explicitly OUT-OF-SCOPE for this phase; the project will deliver foundation artifacts to enable future Snowflake integration.

## Background & Context:
- SOC effectiveness is constrained by detection backlog, alert noise, and fragmented telemetry.
- The organization operates multiple telemetry sources and seeks a unified detection authoring, testing, and deployment pipeline.
- Anvilogic positions itself as a detection-as-code vendor with prebuilt, MITRE-mapped detections and connectors for common SIEMs and data platforms (vendor docs).

## Objectives:
- Objective 1: Improve detection coverage by deploying and validating vendor prebuilt detections mapped to MITRE ATT&CK; measure coverage change using technique coverage reports (threshold: TBD in Planning; measurement: automated coverage comparison pre/post pilot).
- Objective 2: Unify telemetry by normalizing prioritized telemetry sources (endpoint, identity, cloud, SIEM) into canonical schemas; metric: percentage of prioritized sources normalized (threshold: TBD in Planning; measurement: schema conformance reports).
- Objective 3: Establish a governed detection lifecycle (authoring, review, testing, deploy, tuning, deprecation) aligned to MITRE ATT&CK (and D3FEND where applicable); metric: documented process and detections passing maturity gates (threshold: TBD in Planning; measurement: maturity dashboard and change control records).
- Objective 4: Deliver foundation artifacts for future Snowflake integration (high-level data tiering strategy and connector readiness checklist) while keeping Snowflake production work out-of-scope.

## Scope:
- In-Scope:
  - Pilot/PoV deployment of Anvilogic detection-as-code against selected telemetry sources.
  - Deployment, validation, and tuning of vendor prebuilt detections (vendor language: thousands / 1000s of detections).
  - Telemetry canonicalization for in-scope data sources and connector readiness assessment.
  - MITRE ATT&CK mapping and maturity scoring for detections deployed in pilot.
  - Governance artifacts: detection lifecycle policy, role definitions, review gates.
- Out-of-Scope:
  - Production Snowflake integration, data replatforming, or changes to retention/archival policy.
  - Implementation-level artifacts (connectors, schemas, scripts) — only high-level readiness artifacts will be produced.

## Key Stakeholders / Roles:
- Project Sponsor: CISO (executive owner)
- Project Lead / Business Owner: Security Engineering Manager
- Detection Engineering Lead: owns detection acceptance, validation, and tuning
- SOC Manager / IR Lead: owns operational triage acceptance
- Security Architect / Data Platform Owner: owns connector readiness and data access
- Compliance / Risk Representative: governance and retention alignment
- Vendor Engagement: Anvilogic Solution/Customer Success Lead (vendor-owned tasks)

## Success Criteria (metric + threshold or 'TBD in Planning' + measurement approach):
- Detection Coverage: Net increase in MITRE technique coverage relative to baseline. Threshold: TBD in Planning. Measurement: automated technique-coverage report comparing baseline and post-pilot.
- Alert Noise Reduction: Reduction in average alerts per analyst per day (or equivalent SOC workload metric). Threshold: TBD in Planning. Measurement: SOC alert telemetry and analyst feedback surveys.
- Telemetry Normalization: Percentage of prioritized telemetry sources normalized and connected. Threshold: TBD in Planning. Measurement: data pipeline health and schema conformance reports.
- Governance Adoption: Detection lifecycle documented and onboarding of detections through maturity gates. Threshold: TBD in Planning. Measurement: change-control records and maturity dashboard.

## Assumptions & Constraints:
- Assumes access to representative telemetry data for pilot sources and cooperation from data owners.
- Assumes vendor connectors are compatible with existing SIEMs and data platforms for pilot purposes.
- Constraint: No Snowflake production integration during this phase.
- Constraint: This brief contains no implementation-level deliverables or estimates.

## Top Risks (likelihood, impact, mitigation, mitigation owner):
1) Data access/quality issues — Likelihood: Medium; Impact: High. Mitigation: Early data inventory and sample collection; Owner: Security Architect.
2) High false-positive rates from vendor content — Likelihood: High; Impact: Medium. Mitigation: Iterative tuning, use of vendor tuning agents, SOC validation loops; Owner: Detection Engineering Lead.
3) Vendor-content mismatch or exportability concerns — Likelihood: Medium; Impact: Medium. Mitigation: Maintain detection-as-code repository with exportable content; Owner: Security Engineering Manager.
4) Governance acceptance delays — Likelihood: Medium; Impact: Medium. Mitigation: Early Compliance engagement and defined acceptance criteria; Owner: Compliance Representative.

## Recommended Next Steps:
1. Confirm stakeholder owners and secure project sponsorship.
2. Perform data inventory and obtain representative sample datasets for pilot sources.
3. Execute a PoV with Anvilogic for selected pilot scope; validate mapping, tuning, and telemetry normalization.
4. Produce governance artifacts, maturity scoring templates, and a high-level data tiering strategy for future Snowflake work.

Key detection and integration details from the page: Detection-as-Code: visual and code-first builders to create, test, validate, and deploy detections and multi-stage threat scenarios. Supports drag-and-drop filter components and an agentic workbench that extracts behaviors and produces SPL / KQL / SQL logic for instant validation and deployment. Out-of-the-box detections: thousands of prebuilt detections are available, mapped to MITRE by threat group, tactic, data source, and industry vertical. Claims include broad coverage (\"87% of Anvilogic’s detection armory deployed\") and rapid time-to-detection use-case generation (example: 867 detection use cases surfaced in weeks). Integrations & platform flexibility: designed to augment or replace SIEMs without replatforming. Explicit integrations/targets called out: Splunk and Microsoft Sentinel (augment existing SIEM), and data lakes such as Snowflake, Databricks, and Azure Data Explorer. The platform supports hybrid runs (partial in Splunk/Sentinel while shifting detections to data lakes) and claims the ability to correlate signals across endpoint, identity, cloud, and SIEM data without duplicating logic. AI & automation for tuning and triage: ML-based \"Tuning Agents\" continuously monitor the alert data lake to optimize detection logic and reduce alert noise. \"Agentic Triage\" provides a unified investigation panel with prebuilt timelines, MITRE mapping, verdict/context/priority enrichment, and automatic conversion of analyst decisions into repeatable playbooks. Operational benefits and deployment claims: marketed benefits include faster detection build time (5–6×), large reductions in detection engineering effort (60–80%), major alert volume reduction (90% reduction claimed), and cost-savings via hybrid optimization and running on cloud data stores. Offers quickstarts and proofs-of-value (connect real or synthetic data in hours)."}
